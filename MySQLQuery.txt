    select users.username, medias.type, count(medias.type) as medias_qty 
    from users
    inner join medias		on users.id = medias.user_id 
    inner join media_post	on medias.id = media_post.media_id

    from posts 
    left join likes     on posts.id = likes.post_id 
    where likes.post_id is null
    order by posts.`date`;




3. Count the number of likes for each post:

        select likes.post_id, count(likes.post_id) as total_likes
        from likes
        group by likes.post_id 
        order by likes.post_id;


    b.  Case of query with SELECT + JOIN:

        select posts.id , posts.title, count(likes.post_id) as total_likes
        from posts 
        left join likes     on posts.id = likes.post_id
        group by posts.id
        order by posts.id;




4. Sort users by the number of media uploaded:

    select users.username, count(media_post.media_id) as media_count
    from users 
    inner join medias		on users.id = medias.user_id 
    inner join media_post	on medias.id = media_post.media_id
    group by users.username
    order by media_count desc;




5. Sort the users by the total number of likes received on their posts:

    select users.username, likes.user_id, count(likes.user_id) as total_likes
    from likes
    inner join users        on likes.user_id = users.id 
    group by likes.user_id
    order by total_likes desc;
